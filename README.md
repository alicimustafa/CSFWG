# CSFWG-web-page

This the code for the CSFWG website.  CSFWG is non profit.  This web site is single page aplication that is RESTful.  I used CSFWGfunctionalSpec.pdf as guide to build the web site.  That pdf will have more details.  There is also pdf of the ERR Diagram of the database CSFWGmodel.pdf

<b>Getting Started</b>

If you want to install this web site it is very simple just copy all the files as is into any host public_html  directory or if you are using WAMP WWW directory.  Only thing I would change is put the  CSFWGcinfig.ini.php above the root directory so it is not accessible from the web since it hold all of keys and passwords. I did not use any frame works or dependencies.

<b>Prerequisites</b>

You need to be running Apache server with rewrite module turned on 
I used PHP 7.0.10 
I used MySQL 5.7.14
I used Apache 2.4.23 
I used WampServer Version 3.0.6 64bit
